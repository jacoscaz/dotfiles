# As this overrides every LC_ variable above, let's save this for quick'n'dirty
# workarounds to locale issues. Should the need arise, try launching a program 
# in this way:
#
#     $ LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" someprogram
#

# export LC_ALL=""

#
# What about ISO dates? YYYY-MM-DD? The en_DK locale comes to the rescue!
# Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be available on Mac OS (X) and some
# Linux distributions (Ubuntu).
#

if locale -a | grep ^en_DK\.utf8 ; then export LC_TIME="en_DK.utf8"; fi
if locale -a | grep ^en_DK\.UTF-8 ; then export LC_TIME="en_DK.UTF-8"; fi

#
# This makes a few command-line programs (such as ls) print ISO-formatted
# timestamps. Of course, this also does not work on Mac OS (X).
